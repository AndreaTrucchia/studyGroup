    "Bring a project to work on alongside peers. 
    It can be research, homework, open science, or just something fun you're working on. 
    We'll have a Python-themed session so that people can ask questions of other people using the same tools, but everyone is welcome even if you'll be working on something different. 
    Check out the handbook for more information about coworking sessions.
