    Building from our previous lesson, we will go over more 
    advanced statistical analyses using the R programming language, 
    and especially cases where your data may be a little bit messy 
    or you might be working with repeated-measures data 
    (also known as hierarchical data or within-subject data). 
    We'll assume that you are familiar with basic linear regression 
    (e.g. testing if x predicts y) and statistics basics (e.g. how to interpret a p-value), 
    but we will do a brief review and explain everything else as we go!

    This introduction to BASH aims to make participants
    capable of working from the command line in Unix environments.
    The focus of this lesson will be to learn common file system tasks
    and to use built-in tools to make your work more efficient (and fun!).
    This is a beginner level workshop, so no previous knowledge is required.
    A few intermediate level concept will be introduced, but we will not go
    into scripting in BASH.
