    This introduction to BASH aims to make participants
    capable of working from the command line in Unix environments.
    The focus of this lesson will be to learn common file system tasks
    and to use built-in tools to make your work more efficient (and fun!).
    This is a beginner level workshop, so no previous knowledge is required.
    A few intermediate level concept will be introduced, but we will not go
    into scripting in BASH.

    People are talking a lot these days about research being 
    "open" and "reproducible". It all sounds great, but HOW do we do it? 
    How can we apply these great ideals to our actual work?
    This week we'll discuss reproducible computational research, 
    guided by [Ten simple rules for computational research](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285) 
    and Mozilla's [code review guidelines](http://mozillascience.github.io/codeReview/review.html)

    We will have a brief overview of code review (looking over code for mistakes, 
    optimization etc. to increase the overall quality of the code), 
    why you should do it, and how to do it. Then we will jump in and 
    look at some of the attendees' code in pairs or groups. 
    If you have some code that is currently being developed, 
    we encourage you to bring it to the session for code review. 
    Don't worry if you haven't fully optimized it yet, 
    that's why we're holding this session :) 
    Or if you'd prefer you can take part as just a reviewer 
    instead and see how others write code and help them check for errors too!

    Want to be sure your code works as intended? Say hello to unit testing!
    Unit tests are an automated way to check your code for bugs.
    Not only that but developing unit tests will improve your
    code all on its own.

    Building from our previous lesson, we will go over more
    advanced statistical analyses using the R programming language,
    and especially cases where your data may be a little bit messy
    or you might be working with repeated-measures data
    (also known as hierarchical data or within-subject data).
    We'll assume that you are familiar with basic linear regression
    (e.g. testing if x predicts y) and statistics basics (e.g. how to interpret a p-value),
    but we will do a brief review and explain everything else as we go!
